			<p>I'm Tessa or Florian. I'm an eager developer committed to carving a path for open-source accessibility tools to annihilate the daily challenges my disability throws at me... and also having lots of fun with technology and coding!</p>
			<p>I want to bring back the DIY grime and elegaic aesthetic of the old internet. Everyone with anything to say should build themself a little corner exactly how they like it, and I suppose that's what I'm trying to do.</p>
			<p>Many of my repos on here are stubs for things I've worked on for a time, or planned to start but never got off the ground, but there are finished projects too!</p>
			<h3>Current Work</h3>
			<p>I am currently putting a lot of work into developing <a href="https://github.com/FlorianEagox/WeeaBlind">WeeaBlind</a> which has just seen its first BINARY RELEASE</p>
			<p>This is a program to dub videos into other languages using a suite of advanced AI tools. I've been working on it on and off for about a year and it's come a long way!</p>
